# Using-Machine-Learning-to-Improve-Irrigation
Contains the files for integrating several on-field sensors to an arduino. And further integrated to MATLAB to perform predictions using Machine Learning Algorithms (ANNs). The intention is to save as much water as possible in age old irrigation systems.
